## 11/1/2025 - Researched desired keyswitches  

The first thing I need for this project is mechanical keyswitches, obviously. The point of this fidget is to be a stimming toy, so I went about looking for the most tactile keyswitches there are.

I have MX-compatible blue keyswitches at home, but I need those in my keyboard. And there's got to be something clickier!

Searching online, Kailh makes good MX-compatible switches which will also fit in my keyboard. Adafruit sells some of their switches, so I looked at their offerings. The most tactile are the Navy Box switches, so I got 10 of those and some translucent keycaps.

Having also acquired the specs for the switch footprint, I need to iterate designs and prints of the receptacle so I can make sure the switches will fit in my final product.
